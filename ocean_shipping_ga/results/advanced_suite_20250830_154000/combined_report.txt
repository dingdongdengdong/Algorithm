Integrated Analysis:
===================
This suite executed multiple advanced optimization techniques:
- Demand forecasting provided future demand insights using LSTM/statistical models
- Rolling optimization handled time-windowed optimization for scalability
- Adaptive GA system provided real-time adaptation to changing conditions

The combination of these techniques provides a comprehensive solution for
complex ocean shipping optimization under uncertainty and dynamic conditions.
