' Relationships
runner --> ga_opt : creates and runs
ga_opt --> data_loader : loads data
ga_opt --> params : configuration
ga_opt --> fitness : fitness evaluation
ga_opt --> genetic_ops : evolution operations
ga_opt --> population : population management
ga_opt --> plotter : visualization

data_loader --> excel : reads from

fitness --> params : uses parameters
genetic_ops --> params : uses parameters
genetic_ops --> fitness : fitness calculation
population --> params : uses parameters

ga_opt --> individual : manages individuals
genetic_ops --> individual : creates/modifies
population --> individual : initializes

' Data flow
excel ..> data_loader : Excel data

note right of ga_opt
  Main orchestrator that coordinates
  all components for the genetic
  algorithm optimization process
end note

note bottom of fitness
  Implements LP model-based
  fitness calculation with
  constraints and penalties
end note

note bottom of genetic_ops
  Handles selection, crossover,
  mutation, and reproduction
  operations
end note

note bottom of data_loader
  Loads and preprocesses
  Korean Excel files with
  shipping data
end note
